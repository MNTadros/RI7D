                RI7D is a self-imposed challenge, inspired by the Ri3D event created by iR3 Creative Engineering, is an
                intensive robotics competition where a group of aspiring engineers and FIRST Robotics alumni design,
                build, and
                decorate a functional, mostly FRC-legal robot in just <strong>7 days</strong> — far less than the 6
                weeks given to
                high school teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). The focus is on teaching people how to build
                a robot and understand each component within 7 days.

                        Written by <strong>Mina</strong>, the Control Systems Lead for the project, this article
                        focuses primarily on the electronics and software side of the robot. While the mechanical and
                        CAD teams made incredible progress, I didn’t personally work on those aspects, so I can’t
                        comment on them in detail. From debugging outdated hardware to wrestling with faulty components,
                        this is the story of how we made it work—against all odds.<br><br>
                        The journey was far from smooth—delays, outdated hardware, and faulty parts made it a constant
                        uphill battle. Despite everything going wrong, we still managed to achieve our goal: teaching
                        people about FRC Robotics and how to build a robot in 7 days.<br><br>
                        As an inside joke from our team, we considered rebranding this as RO0D (Robot On 0 Dollars)
                        since that seemed more impressive than our final product.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                            On Day 1, we kicked off the event at the ACE Climatic Wind Tunnel in Oshawa, where we met
                            with other Toronto-area teams, shared ideas, and brainstormed strategies. The energy was
                            electric as we discussed the game animation, reviewed the rulebook, and identified the
                            subsystems we’d need to build. Mentees were introduced to the project, and everyone left the
                            kickoff feeling motivated and ready to tackle the challenge.<br><br>
                            At this point, we didn’t think much about what we had—or didn’t have. The only things in our
                            possession were a drivetrain and literally nothing else. No inventory, no spare parts, no
                            tools beyond the basics. But we were too caught up in the excitement to worry. After hours
                            of brainstorming and planning as a team, we went home with a solid plan to start prototyping
                            our ideas the next day. Little did we know, things wouldn’t go as smoothly as we hoped.

                            On Day 2, we didnt have access to our workspace, so we began trying to pick a point-scoring
                            scheme to
                            focus on. After much deliberation, we decided to focus on creating a mechanism that could
                            score coral and process algae. (If you’re not familiar with FRC, here’s a link to the <a

                            We finally settled on what we thought would be our final design and began identifying
                            potential issues before prototyping it with wood. Meanwhile, I compiled a list of
                            electronics we needed to borrow from other teams, and team members went out to gather the
                            necessary components. In a moment of overconfidence (or sheer optimism), I started working
                            on the code without even considering the hardware we had—or didn’t have. (I now know, that
                            it wasn't the best idea)<br><br>
                            By the end of the day, we weren’t entirely satisfied with our design so we had to scrap it,
                            but we managed to
                            secure a RoboRIO, radio, and PDP from another team, which we would receive the next morning
                            (Day 3).

                        By the beginning of Day 3, the reality of our tight deadline started to sink in. With only four
                        days left and not much progress to show for the first two days, the team began to feel the
                        weight of the situation. The pressure was mounting, and the stress was palpable.

                            and four motor controllers. That’s when we realized something glaringly obvious—we didn’t
                            have a battery. Without a battery, we couldn’t test any of the electronics, and we couldn’t
                            test any of the code. It was a major roadblock that brought everything to a
                            standstill.<br><br>
                            With nothing to do on the control systems side, most of the control systems team pitched in
                            to help with mechanical and CAD work wherever they could. It was a frustrating and
                            demoralizing day, but we had no choice but to keep pushing forward.

                            By Day 4, we were fully locked in. We borrowed a battery and a VRM (Voltage Regulation
                            Module), only to realize we didn’t have the right cable to power the VRM. So, one of us went
                            out
                            and bought the cable (that was only avaliable from a store 4 hours away). Then, we
                            discovered we didn’t have the lugs for the 6 AWG wire needed
                            to connect the battery. So its my turn for a trip to the store, and we finally had what we
                            needed. These
                            days were a whirlwind—every problem that came up, we tackled head-on without slowing down.

                                Let me tell you about the time I went on a mission to buy lugs. Picture this: Me and
                                some people from the team are
                                standing in the hardware store, staring at a wall of electrical components, trying to
                                figure out which lugs are the right size for 6 AWG wire. After a few minutes of
                                confusion (and maybe a little panic), we finally found what we needed. It wasn’t exactly
                                a glamorous moment, but it was a small victory in the grand scheme of things. Little did
                                I know, this was just the beginning of our troubleshooting adventures.

                                during the build.

                            With the battery and VRM in place, we could finally flash the radio and the RoboRIO,
                            allowing us to start testing and working on the software side of the robot. After flashing
                            the radio, we spent some time trying to push code, but nothing was working. The motor
                            controllers were flashing strange colors, and after wasting some time, I looked up the error
                            codes. Turns out, they were indicating a <strong>sticky fault</strong>.<br><br>
                            <strong>What’s a sticky fault?</strong> It’s a persistent error in the motor controller that
                            doesn’t clear automatically and requires manual intervention to reset. According to the PDF
                            spec sheet for the motor controller, I needed to connect to the RoboRIO or PDP (Power
                            Distribution Panel) to clear the faults manually. The PDP, however, was made in 2015 and
                            didn’t have a USB-C port or anything modern—so I had to plug into the RoboRIO
                            instead.<br><br>
                            But when I opened Phoenix Tuner (a software tool used to configure and diagnose CAN devices
                            on FRC robots), nothing showed up. This meant there was likely an issue
                            with the CAN wiring. At this point, literally anything could be wrong—this was the first
                            time I was dealing with this hardware, and after double- and triple-checking everything, we
                            still couldn’t clear the sticky faults or test if any of the components worked. It was a
                            frustrating setback, and we started to dread what Day 6 might bring.

                            Deciding to start Day 6 with a fresh mind, I arrived at the workspace early and decided to
                            tackle the CAN wiring issue head-on. I re-did all the CAN wires, plugged my laptop into the
                            RoboRIO, and opened Phoenix Tuner. To my surprise—and slight frustration—it just worked. On
                            the first try. I tried to balance my anger at how simple the solution was with the relief of
                            finally making progress.<br><br>
                            At this point, the only way to make the robot move was to manually set the output percent of
                            a motor controller using a slider in Phoenix Tuner. But just seeing the robot’s wheels spin
                            was enough to give the entire team a much-needed boost of motivation. It was a small
                            victory, but it reminded us that we were capable of overcoming the challenges in front of
                            us.<br><br>
                            With the CAN communication issue resolved, I could now access the firmware for the PDP and
                            motor controllers. After more scavenging on the internet, I managed to flash newer firmware
                            onto the devices. But just as one problem was solved, another emerged. When I was writing
                            the code for the robot, I had used WPILib 2024, thinking there wouldn’t be much of a
                            difference—and, admittedly, out of laziness. However, I had flashed the RoboRIO with 2025
                            firmware. Naturally, pushing 2024 code to a 2025 RoboRIO didn’t work at all (which, to be
                            fair, makes sense). So, it was time to install WPILib 2025 and rewrite the code.<br><br>
                            By the end of the day, the code and firmware for the RoboRIO were aligned, the motor
                            controllers and PDP had no faults, and all the electrical components that needed a team
                            number were properly configured. I tested and confirmed that all the motor controllers were
                            working. It felt like we were finally making real progress.<br><br>
                            As I left the workspace that evening, I thought everything would finally work together the
                            next morning—the morning of the 7th and final day. Little did I know, the issues never stop.

                        confirmation message, no error message, nothing in the console. Hmm.<br><br>
                        I rechecked all the motor controllers, and they worked fine when I manually gave them a percent
                        output. To avoid wasting more time, I immediately went back to the Victor SPX documentation.
                        That's when I realized there were about four different types of Victor SPX classes in WPILib. I
                        thought it might be a code issue. I used the exact code from the documentation for this specific
                        model of motor controller, and it still didn't work. Great!<br><br>
                        I reflashed the radio again and eventually replaced it with another one we borrowed from a
                        different team. After reflashing the radio and setting its team number, I tested the controller,
                        and... WE WERE DRIVING, BABY! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO! From there, I worked on setting up the
                        controller to drive properly with the robot and optimized it so it drove cleaner.<br><br>
                        At this point, the mechanical and CAD teams had faced their own challenges and struggles
                        throughout the 7 days, and everyone was just glad we had a moving, functioning robot. I honestly
                        believe it was genuinely harder to combine a bunch of old, random components together than it
                        would have been to build a regular bot that could do the same thing from new components. We
                        built this robot on $0 (kind of!?). It was a real challenge, but at least we had a finished
                        product, and we learned some invaluable life and engineering skills and lessons.<br><br>
                        I am incredibly proud of what we achieved in just 7 days. This experience has given me the
                        confidence that, with the lessons we've learned, we could build an even better robot in just
                        <strong>3 days</strong> next time. (Exciting, right? Next time, here we come!)

                    Spoiler alert: It was a <strong>mess</strong>. The design wasn’t finalized until day 5, the robot
                    had no power until day 4, and the electrical components were ancient—some even faulty. (Some
                    datasheets were so outdated, they didn’t even exist anymore. I spent hours just trying to figure out
                    how to use this hardware.)<br><br>
                    We started with no inventory. Every part had to be borrowed, leading to constant delays. The robot
                    didn’t drive until the <em>final hours</em> of the event—and even then, we had to disassemble it
                    immediately to return the borrowed parts.<br><br>
                    On day 7, I thought all I had to do was push code and set up the controller. Easy, right? Wrong.
                    After 30 minutes of failed attempts, I reflashed the radio—still nothing. No errors, no messages,
                    just silence. I double-checked the motor controllers—they worked manually, so the issue had to be in
                    the code.<br><br>
                    Turns out, there were multiple versions of the motor controller class in the library. I used the
                    exact example from the docs for our model, and it still didn’t work. Fantastic. After reflashing the
                    radio again and borrowing a replacement, I finally got it working. WE WERE DRIVING! LET’S
                    GO!<br><br>
                    Despite the chaos, we pulled it off. Combining old, random parts was harder than building from
                    scratch, but we did it on a $0 budget (kind of). We learned invaluable lessons and proved we could
                    do it even better next time—maybe in just <strong>3 days</strong>.
